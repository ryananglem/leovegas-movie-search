    <h2>JavaScript recruitment assessment</h2>
    <p>When recruiting new developers it’s always tricky to know how good of a developer a person is.
    As a recruiter you wouldn’t hire anyone you don’t know is good, and frankly as a developer you
    probably wouldn’t want to be hired by someone that doesn't know how good you are. I mean,
    how would you get the salary you deserve?
    </p>
    <p>
    So an assessment of some form is required, and this is it. It’s probably not the first one you’ve
    done so I’ve tried to do it as fun as possible, see it as a hobby project you actually can use
    when you’re done.
    </p>
    <p>
    So here at LeoVegas we like React. Like, a lot. We hope you do too. So let’s start by creating a
    git repository and a new React project, and don’t forget to give it a cool name.
    There’s something I like more than React though it is movies. Especially good movies. But also
    bad movies. So what we’re gonna build today is an application for searching for just that,
    movies. The app must look good in desktop as well as mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
    Feature wise we’ll need:
    <ul>
    <li>A search field and like a table for showing the result.</li>
    <li>It should also have functionality for setting movies as your favourites, maybe with a star
    symbol in the table.</li>
    <li>A list where you can add movies you want to watch, like the “watch later” functionality on
    YouTube.</li>
    <li>Make Sure to test the application and write the tests in the Repo.</li>
    <li>The App Must Be working on desktop as well as mobile.</li>
    <li>Posters and trailers are always nice, this is however up to you.(Optional)</li>
    <li>Last but definitely NOT least, please include a Demo for us to see.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    To get the data for movies you can use any API you want, but if I were you, I'd use the API
    provided by TMDb: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
    When you’re done, send us the repo and sit back, relax, and be proud of your work. No doubt
    we’ll hire you after a performance like this.
    </p>
